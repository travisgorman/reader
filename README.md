#Confirming actions


##Practice using state with React

* Create a document reader app, 
* that allows users to read a document and mark that document as read.
* Use a checkbox to allow a user to mark a document as read
* When the user checks the checkbox, it should become checked 
* AND they should be prompted to confirm whether they truly read the document (perhaps with a modal)
* If they confirm, the box should remain checked AND become disabled.
* If they cancel, the box should go back to being unchecked.
